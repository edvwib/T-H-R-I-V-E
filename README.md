# T-H-R-I-V-E
### This is a landing page for the store [T H R I V E](http://www.thrivestore.se/)
### The goals for the landing page were to...
- ...educate in the field of sustainable clothing.
- ...get people involved in the movement away from fast fashion.
- ...show that there are alternatives to fast fashion.

The page is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The following libraries/frameworks are used:
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) (which also includes [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)), was used to layout the elements, not to style anything visibly.
- [Cocoen](https://github.com/koenoe/cocoen), was used to create the slider between two images for comparison. Slightly modified to fit our style and the transistions we wanted.
